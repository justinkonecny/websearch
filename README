Searches/parses craigslist.org for valid vehicle listings matching user criteria

======Description======
Once executed, the program prompts the user for the search model. Upon entering the model, or entering '$all', the program
beings searching craigslist.org for listings of car models that match preset criteria (price, miles, year). The search
processes listings in three different listing regions. Entering '$all' will search for all preset models (at this time, these are "mercedes", "bmw", and "wrangler"). After processing
all listings, the user will be prompted to enter commands (listed below) to interact with the results.

======Commands======
'reduce': eliminates duplicate listings
'show all': lists the age and title of all saved listings
'show #': shows the description of the # listing (e.g 'show 3' displays the third listing found)
